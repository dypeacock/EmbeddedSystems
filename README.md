This is the code for an Arduino Smart Home device I created for my Embedded Systems module at University.

I used C++ to create a “dummy” hub for various types of smart home devices such as speakers, sockets, lights, thermostats and cameras. 

It is designed to read custom messages such as adding new devices or regulating them using the Serial Monitor, and display the results on the LCD screen after processing them.

I learned to manage the limited SRAM space of embedded devices, making informed decisions about the datatypes I used in order to free up valuable space.
